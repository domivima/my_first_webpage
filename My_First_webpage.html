                <p><h2>How JavaScript started</h2>
                    <ul>
                    <li>September 1995, Brendan Eich, a programmer at Netscape developed a programming language in just 10 days.</li>
                    <li>This language was initially called Mocha, then LiveScript.</li>
                    <li>In December 1995 Netscape and Sun(the organisation that owned Java) had a license agreement regarding Javascript(then LiveScript) hence it was renamed to Javascript and specifically "Java" script because Java was the most popular language at that time and this would help the marketing of Javascript as well.</li>
                    <li>Javascript grew rapidly since then and in 1997 ECMA was given the responsibility to create a specification for the language</li>
                    <li>Today Javascript is used by millions of developers and is used in major sites such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.</li>
                    </ul>

        <p> JavaScript language comes from the times when early web browsers were being developed. Netscape Communications company in 1994 created Netscape Navigator that became the most popular web browser in the 90s.</p>
        <p> In 1995 Netscape Communications employed Brendan Eich to develop scripting language for web browser. Eich prepared it in a  very short time. First version of new language had Mocha name, whereas official version used in Netscape Navigator 2 beta version was called LiveScript. In the same 1995 year new developed scripting language was renamed to JavaScript and used in next beta version of Netscape Navigator 2. LiveScript followed a lot of Java features. This, but above all the desire to use the growing popularity of Java to call positive associations with a new language where reasons that it was finally called JavaScript. Also implementation of the language for server-side was introduced.</p>
        <p> In this time Microsoft to compete with Netscape decided to include scripting technologies in their browser. In 1996 they released Internet Explorer 3 with their own implementation of JavaScript called JScript.</p>
        <p> Since that time there were two versions of JavaScript. This brought a compatibility issues. Industry needs caused that decided to standardize language.  Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International to “standardize the syntax and semantics of a general purpose, cross-platform, vendor-neutral scripting language”. In 1997 was published the language specification called ECMAScript as a ECMA-262 standard. Other browser vendors could use this specification to prepare their implementation.</p>
        <p> In the following years, the development of JavaScript was continued and in cycles were released new versions of specification. Responsible for the development of JavaScript are Mozilla Fundation (which is successor of Netscape Navigator) and Ecma International.</p>
